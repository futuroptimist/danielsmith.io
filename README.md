# danielsmith.io

Production-ready Vite + Three.js playground for the future danielsmith.io experience.
The scene renders an orthographic isometric room with keyboard-driven sphere movement so
we can iterate on spatial UX while keeping repo hygiene tight. The project was originally
bootstrapped from the [`flywheel`](https://github.com/futuroptimist/flywheel) template and
keeps the familiar conventions while focusing purely on the web stack.

## Key resources

- **Roadmap** – Long-term milestones are sequenced in [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md)
  covering lighting, environment, HUD work, accessibility, and avatar polish.
- **Backlog** – Near-term scene tasks, including deferred touch controls, live in
  [docs/backlog.md](docs/backlog.md).
- **Résumé** – Latest résumé source is
  [`resume.tex`][resume-src].
  CI renders PDF and DOCX artifacts.
- **Prompt library** – Automation-ready Codex prompts are summarized in
  [`summary.md`][prompt-summary] and expanded across topical files in
  `docs/prompts/codex/` (automation, lighting, avatar, HUD, POIs, accessibility, and more).

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Floor plan

The prototype now spans two connected rooms that form an L-shaped footprint. A doorway carved into the
shared wall links the living space to the studio, letting us explore navigation through multiple
zones. The LED strips that edge each room can be tuned independently (for example, green for the
living room and blue for the studio) so color palettes can evolve per space.

The top-down diagram below is generated by CI whenever the floor plan changes (and can be refreshed
locally with `npm run floorplan:diagram`).

## Project scripts

| Script                                          | Purpose                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`                                   | Start the Vite development server.                          |
| `npm run build`                                 | Create a production build (also used by CI smoke tests).    |
| `npm run preview`                               | Preview the production build locally.                       |
| `npm run lint`                                  | Run ESLint on the TypeScript sources.                       |
| `npm run format:check` / `npm run format:write` | Check or apply Prettier formatting.                         |
| `npm run test` / `npm run test:ci`              | Execute the Vitest suite (CI uses `:ci`).                   |
| `npm run typecheck`                             | Type-check with TypeScript without emitting files.          |
| `npm run docs:check`                            | Ensure required docs (including Codex prompts) exist.       |
| `npm run smoke`                                 | Build and assert that `dist/index.html` exists.             |
| `npm run check`                                 | Convenience command chaining lint, test:ci, and docs:check. |

### Local quality gates

Run the Flywheel-style checks before pushing to stay aligned with CI:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run test:ci
npm run docs:check
npm run smoke
```

Pre-commit mirrors these commands alongside formatting hooks. Compared to the full
Flywheel stack, we skip the Python-heavy aggregate hook to keep this web-focused repo
lightweight.

## Architecture notes

- **Camera** – Orthographic camera with a constant world height (`CAMERA_SIZE = 20`). On resize we recompute the left/right bounds from the new aspect ratio and call `updateProjectionMatrix()` to keep scale consistent.
- **Lighting** – Ambient + directional key lights are now complemented by emissive LED cove strips
  with a lightweight bloom pass so the room inherits a soft gradient glow without heavy shadows.
- **Controls** – `KeyboardControls` listens for `keydown`/`keyup` using `event.key` strings (WASD + arrow keys) and feeds the movement loop, which clamps the player inside the room bounds.
- **Backlog** – Future scene work is tracked in [`docs/backlog.md`](docs/backlog.md).

## Controls

- **Movement** – Use `WASD` or arrow keys to roll the sphere.
- **Touch** – Not implemented yet; see the backlog entry for the planned joystick.

## Automation prompts

The canonical Codex automation prompt lives at
[`automation.md`][automation-prompt] and feeds both docs
checks and CI routines. Additional specialized prompts (lighting, avatar, HUD, POIs, i18n,
performance, modes, animation, and more) provide ready-to-run task scaffolding for agents.

## Smoke testing

`npm run build` generates distributable assets, and CI asserts that `dist/index.html`
exists as part of the smoke suite.
