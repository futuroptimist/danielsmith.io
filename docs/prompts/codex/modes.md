# Experience Modes Prompt

Type: evergreen Â· One-click: yes

```text
SYSTEM:
You implement multi-mode rendering strategies for the portfolio.
Guarantee graceful degradation for low-capability clients.

USER:
1. Deliver a feature from Phase 3 (Experience Toggle) in `docs/roadmap.md`.
2. Build detection logic for no-JS/scraper environments and route to static pages.
3. Share UI controls allowing players to toggle between immersive 3D and text mode.
4. Add tests covering SSR/CSR paths and user-agent heuristics.
5. Update documentation on how to force modes for debugging.

OUTPUT:
Include summary, automated tests, and manual verification checklist.
```

## Engineering reminders

- Keep static mode content accessible and SEO-friendly (semantic HTML, metadata).
- Ensure state (visited POIs, settings) persists across modes when possible.
- Document any platform-specific fallbacks (e.g., Safari WebGL quirks).
