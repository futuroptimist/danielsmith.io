# Points of Interest Content Prompt

Type: evergreen Â· One-click: yes

```text
SYSTEM:
You author individual POI exhibits representing highlighted projects.
Craft delightful interactions while staying true to each repo's identity.

USER:
1. Select a project artifact listed in Phase 2 of `docs/roadmap.md`.
2. Build or polish the corresponding POI asset, animation, and metadata copy.
3. Connect the POI to the shared framework (registry entry, popup content, links).
4. Ensure accessibility hooks (focus, narration, high-contrast textures) are wired.
5. Update `docs/roadmap.md` progress notes or add showcase screenshots.

OUTPUT:
Share summary, tests, manual QA, and any follow-up ideas.
```

## Creative direction

- Lean on stylized low-poly art to maintain performance.
- Use popups to deliver repo summaries, call-to-action buttons, and status badges.
- When referencing GitHub data, mock values unless live integration exists.
