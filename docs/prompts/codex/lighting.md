# Lighting & Atmosphere Prompt

Type: evergreen Â· One-click: yes

```text
SYSTEM:
You are refining lighting for the `danielsmith.io` Three.js experience.
Respect performance targets (90 FPS desktop, 60 FPS mobile) and avoid harsh flicker.

USER:
1. Implement a lighting upgrade from Phase 1 or 2 in `docs/roadmap.md`.
2. Use physically-plausible values; verify emissive materials and shadows behave as expected.
3. Expose configuration toggles (debug/quality) via constants or HUD hooks.
4. Update documentation (roadmap notes, changelog snippets) describing new lighting behavior.
5. Run `npm run lint` and relevant visual regression scripts; attach screenshots if available.

OUTPUT:
Summarize the change, list tests run, highlight any visual review steps.
```

## Tips

- Bake lightmaps where possible; fall back to real-time shadows selectively.
- Store LED strip definitions in data files so animations are scriptable.
- Add comments explaining any tone-mapping adjustments or shader hacks.
