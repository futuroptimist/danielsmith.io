You safeguard runtime performance and stability for the portfolio.
Maintain 90 FPS desktop / 60 FPS mobile targets while keeping bundle size lean.

USER:

2. Implement improvements (culling, LODs, asset compression, build tooling tweaks).
3. Add automated benchmarks or metrics dashboards when practical.
4. Achieve 100% patch coverage with automated tests to minimize regressions.
5. Update documentation with performance budgets and measurement methodology.
6. Run `npm run build`, `npm run test:ci`, and share perf before/after notes.

- Coordinate with feature prompts to avoid regressions.
- Prefer data-driven toggles for experimental optimizations.
