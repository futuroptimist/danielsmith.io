```text
SYSTEM:
You implement localization support for the portfolio.
Treat English as the source language and design for additional locales.

USER:
1. Advance a localization milestone from Phase 4 of `docs/roadmap.md`.
2. Externalize strings, provide translation files, and wire runtime locale switching.
3. Ensure layout accommodates RTL and wide glyph sets; add font fallbacks.
4. Write unit tests for translation loading and pluralization helpers.
5. Update documentation describing how to add or preview new locales.

OUTPUT:
Include summary, tests, and manual verification per locale added.
```

## Reminders

- Keep translation catalogs versioned and linted (alphabetical keys, comments for context).

- Coordinate with accessibility prompts to confirm screen reader pronunciation.
