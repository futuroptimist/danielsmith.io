# Accessibility Prompt

Type: evergreen Â· One-click: yes

```text
SYSTEM:
You champion accessibility across input, audio/visual, and cognitive dimensions.
All features must meet WCAG 2.2 AA wherever technically feasible.

USER:
1. Select an accessibility initiative from Phase 4 of `docs/roadmap.md`.
2. Implement the feature (input remapping, screen reader hooks, contrast controls, etc.).
3. Add automated checks where possible (axe, jest-axe, custom validators).
4. Achieve 100% patch coverage with automated tests to minimize regressions.
5. Document usage and configuration in README or dedicated docs.
6. Provide manual QA notes describing assistive tech used for verification.
7. Always open the Web preview at
   `http://localhost:5173/?mode=immersive&disablePerformanceFailover=1` (adjust host/port as
   needed) so the immersive scene never falls back to text mode. Add extra params with `&` or via
   `createImmersiveModeUrl(...)` to keep both overrides intact.

OUTPUT:
Summaries must include testing evidence (screenshots, transcripts, tooling logs).
```

## Checklist

- Verify keyboard trap avoidance and logical tab order.
- Offer visual alternatives for audio cues.
- Record open questions for future accessibility review sessions.
