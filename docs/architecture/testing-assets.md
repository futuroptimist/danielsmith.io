# Testing and asset automation

This guide captures how automated checks validate the immersive scene and how
auto-generated artifacts stay up to date.

## Test suites

| Suite                    | Location                      | Command                | Notes |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----- |
| Unit & integration tests | `src/tests/` (Vitest)         | `npm run test:ci`      | Run with `CI=1` locally to mirror pipeline timeouts and disable watch mode. |
| End-to-end + visual      | `playwright/` (Playwright)    | `npm run test:e2e`     | Uses the same immersive URL overrides as production. Set `CI=1` to lock workers to 1 for deterministic WebGL boot. |
| Smoke build check        | Vite production build output  | `npm run smoke`        | Ensures `npm run build` succeeds and that `dist/index.html` exists. |
| Linting & types          | Source TypeScript             | `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck` | Linting runs ESLint; `npm run check` chains lint, tests, and docs validation. |

### Visual diff budgets

Playwright screenshot assertions inherit tolerances from
[`VISUAL_SMOKE_DIFF_BUDGET`](../../src/assets/performance.ts). `maxDiffPixelRatio`
(1.5%) and `maxDiffPixels` (1,200) balance bloom noise against meaningful scene
changes. Update both the asset and this doc if thresholds move.

## Keyboard traversal macro

[`playwright/keyboard-traversal.spec.ts`](../../playwright/keyboard-traversal.spec.ts)
exercises the WASD onboarding loop, POI focus order, HUD announcements, and text
mode failover. Extend this spec whenever new POIs or HUD modals ship so keyboard
coverage remains comprehensive.

## Auto-generated assets

| Script                      | Output path                      | Trigger |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------- |
| `npm run floorplan:diagram` | `docs/assets/floorplan-*.svg`    | Run after floor geometry or labels change. CI refreshes the diagrams post-merge. |
| `npm run launch:screenshot` | `docs/assets/game-launch.png`    | Run after lighting, HUD, or camera framing changes. CI captures a fresh launch pose on every merge. |

Regenerate affected assets locally before committing so diffs stay deterministic.
Document the update in commit messages when budgets or captures shift.
