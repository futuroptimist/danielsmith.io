# Backlog

## Planned improvements

The backlog now tracks near-term slices derived from `docs/roadmap.md`. Use it to spotlight
tasks that deserve immediate attention while the roadmap handles long-range planning.

- feat: HUD overlay spikes (controls, help modal)
- feat: POI registry scaffolding + first content pass
- feat: ground floor layout blocking & navigation QA
- perf: lighting pipeline prototype (emissive strips + baked bounce)
